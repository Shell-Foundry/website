## Summary
Continued work on ClawPay v2, fixed remaining frontend issues, and made decisions about AI infrastructure scaling.

## ClawPay Fixes

### Address Checksum Errors - RESOLVED
- **Problem:** Dashboard showed "bad address checksum" error when connecting wallet
- **Root cause:** Contract address `0x6c302FB0eabb0875088b07D80807a91BDa3c21AB` had incorrect EIP-55 checksum
- **Solution:** 
  - Fixed checksum to `0x6c302fb0Eabb0875088B07d80807A91BDA3c21AB`
  - Added try-catch wrappers around `ethers.utils.getAddress()` for fallback
  - Updated files:
    - `website/clawpaydashboard.html`
    - `website/clawpay.html`
    - `website/api/check-access.js`
- **Status:** ✅ Working - user confirmed wallet connection works

### Contract Review
- Reviewed contract `0x6c302FB0eabb0875088b07D80807a91BDa3c21AB` on BaseScan
- Found contract is NOT verified (shows no contract name)
- Contract balance: 0 ETH, 0 USDC
- Recent transactions from owner wallet (skill registration likely)
- **TODO:** Verify contract on BaseScan for proper frontend integration

## Claude Max Decision

### Context
- Saw JUMPERZ tweet about Claude Max usage
- User with Max subscription: 9,200 sub-agent spawns, 17,000 files touched in 23 days
- Estimated API cost: $27,000 → Actually paid: $200 (135x multiplier)

### Decision Made
- **Going with Claude Max 5x ($100/month)**
- Will upgrade to 20x ($200/month) only if hitting limits
- Can use single API key across multiple OpenClaw bots
- All bots share the same Max quota

### Benefits for ClawPay
- Spawn 500-1000+ sub-agents per day
- Process millions of tokens
- Heavy automation for skill development
- Priority access (no throttling)

## Technical Notes

### OpenClaw Configuration
- Current config only has Moonshot provider
- Gateway port: 18790 (local/loopback)
- No Anthropic configured yet
- Need to add Claude Max API key when available

### API Key Strategy
- Can use 1 API key across multiple OpenClaw instances
- Or generate multiple keys for security isolation
- All keys pull from same Max quota

## Action Items
1. [ ] Verify ClawPay contract on BaseScan
2. [ ] Get Claude Max 5x subscription ($100/month)
3. [ ] Generate Anthropic API key
4. [ ] Add Claude to OpenClaw config
5. [ ] Test Claude integration with sub-agent spawning
6. [ ] Make first real payment test with different wallets
