APPROACH 3: Mobile Site with Enter Key + Screenshots

Test Plan:
1. Load mobile.x.com/login
2. Fill username field
3. Wait 3 seconds for page to update
4. Take screenshot (manual check)
5. Fill password field (if visible) OR find password field
6. Press Enter to submit
7. Take screenshot of result

This avoids clicking "Next" and uses Enter key instead.

Alternative: Desktop site x.com/login might have different flow
